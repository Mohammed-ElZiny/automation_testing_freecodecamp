# FreeCodeCamp Website Testing Project

This project focuses on the quality assurance and testing of the FreeCodeCamp website using Selenium and TestNG. The project aims to ensure that various functionalities of the website perform as expected and that potential issues are identified and addressed.

## Features Tested

- **Register with New Account:** 
  - Automated tests are conducted to verify the functionality of registering with a new account. This includes input validation, successful registration, and error handling.

- **Login to Existing Account:**
  - Automated tests validate the login process for existing accounts. This includes entering valid credentials, handling authentication errors, and accessing user-specific content upon successful login.

- **Surfing the Curriculum:**
  - Tests are conducted to ensure smooth navigation through the curriculum. This involves verifying the visibility and accessibility of different learning paths and courses.

- **Changing Username:**
  - Automated tests validate the functionality of changing the username associated with the account. This includes entering new username details, updating the username, and verifying the changes.

- **Obtaining Course Certificate:**
  - Tests are performed to ensure that users can successfully obtain course certificates upon completion of a course. This includes validating the certificate generation process and verifying its accuracy.

- **Making a Donation:**
  - Automated tests ensure the donation process functions correctly. This involves simulating a donation transaction, handling payment methods, and verifying donation acknowledgments.

- **Opening the Forum and Searching for Topics:**
  - Tests validate the functionality of accessing the forum section and searching for specific topics. This includes verifying the search functionality, accessing relevant discussions, and displaying search results accurately.

## Tools Used

- **Selenium:**
  - Selenium is used for automating web browsers to perform regression testing on web applications. It enables interaction with web elements, form submissions, and navigation.

- **TestNG:**
  - TestNG is used as the testing framework for organizing and executing test cases. It provides functionalities such as test case prioritization, parallel execution, and reporting.

## How to Run Tests

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
   - Install Selenium WebDriver and TestNG dependencies in your project.

2. **Clone Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Configure Tests:**
   - Customize test parameters, such as login credentials and test data, in the test scripts as needed.

4. **Execute Tests:**
   - Run the test suite using TestNG. You can execute tests either from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or through the command line.

   ```bash
   $ mvn clean test
   ```
5. **View Test Results:**
       - After test execution, review the test reports generated by TestNG to identify any failures or errors.
